‚öïÔ∏è HEALIA: An AI-Assisted Telemedicine Platform
üåü The Challenge
Access to quality healthcare remains a significant challenge, particularly in remote and underserved areas where a lack of infrastructure and limited medical professionals create immense gaps in care. Patients often struggle to understand their symptoms and are unsure when to seek professional medical advice, leading to delayed diagnoses and overburdened healthcare systems. The current landscape lacks a comprehensive, inclusive, and personalized digital solution that truly bridges this gap, providing a first line of defense and a trusted connection to medical experts.
